Lab 5: Functions and Graphics

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, you will implement functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. These functions will allow users to change the background color of the display, and “draw” horizontal and vertical lines on the display. To simulate a display, we’ll be using the memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool included with MARS.

INSTRUCTIONS

First thing first, I learned what is marco and how use the % instead of the t and s regeister. 
Then, I code how to get and fromat the coordinate plus the get the pixel address.
Then, I code how to clear the map with turn it into full green.
Then, I start going to labs to get to know how to draw lines.
After couple of labs sections, I learn you need to from the address and use draw pixel to draw lines and it would stops when reach 128 pixels.
Then, I move the s register into a0 and a1 to store colors and draw lines.
